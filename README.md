Exploring Best Practices for Data-Driven SwiftUI Apps with SwiftData.

## Overview
This project delves into various architectures powered by SwiftData to uncover best practices for crafting data-driven SwiftUI apps that uphold efficiency, maintainability, and scalability.

## SwiftData with ViewModel
SwiftData's approach to data management often reduces the need for traditional ViewModel, as it handles queries and data transformations directly within database entities, rather than relying on a separate ViewModel layer for this purpose.

Therefore, we create two apps: one using a pure SwiftData approach and the other incorporating SwiftData with ViewModel, to compare their architectures and evaluate their effectiveness in different scenarios.

### Starwars
Demonstrates a pure SwiftData implementation, integrating with a REST API.

### StarwarsMVVM - ViewModel + SwiftData + REST API
Demonstrates a ViewModel-based approach using SwiftData and a REST API.

In StarwarsMVVM, the approach involves manually fetching SwiftData instead of utilizing @Query annotations for ViewModel usage. This can lead to potential issues, including:

- Redundancy: Manually syncing data between the database and ViewModel can introduce redundancy and increase the likelihood of inconsistencies.
- Manual Database Management: Requires careful manual handling of database consistency to prevent potential app crashes. This risk could reducing by using memory-only data container.

### Conclusion
SwiftData empowers developers to create efficient and maintainable data-driven SwiftUI apps without relying solely on ViewModels. By leveraging its query capabilities and exploring alternative patterns like transformers and repositories, we can achieve well-structured and simplified code that aligns with Swift's evolution.
